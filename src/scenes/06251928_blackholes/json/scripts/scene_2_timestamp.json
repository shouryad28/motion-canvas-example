  "script": "[0.20] Now [0.40] that [0.52] we [0.64] understand [1.14] what [1.28] a [1.34] black [1.60] hole [1.86] is, [2.18] let's [2.36] explore [2.82] the [2.92] *theoretical [3.54] foundation* [4.40] that [4.56] predicted [5.02] their [5.22] existence. [7.30] ... [7.36] In [7.46] 1915, [8.40] Albert [8.68] Einstein [9.24] revolutionized [10.10] our [10.24] understanding [10.84] of [10.98] gravity [11.46] with [11.62] his [11.84] theory [12.24] of [12.34] *general [12.78] relativity*. [14.34] Unlike [14.74] Newton's [15.08] view [15.26] of [15.38] gravity [15.76] as [15.88] a [16.02] force, [16.90] Einstein [17.44] showed [17.78] that [17.96] massive [18.42] objects [19.04] actually [19.46] _curve [19.88] the [20.04] fabric [20.46] of [20.62] spacetime [21.16] itself_. [22.38] ... [22.42] His [22.66] field [22.92] equations [23.56] mathematically [24.24] describe [24.76] how [25.34] *mass [25.84] and [26.04] energy* [26.76] bend [27.18] space [27.58] and [27.76] time [28.06] around [28.34] them. [29.40] Just [29.72] one [29.92] year [30.14] later, [30.98] in [31.10] 1916, [32.70] German [33.08] physicist [34.00] *Karl [34.44] Schwarzschild* [35.80] found [36.00] the [36.18] first [36.48] exact [36.92] solution [37.40] to [37.54] Einstein's [38.04] equations. [40.30] ... [40.36] This [40.56] solution [41.06] predicted [41.52] something [41.84] extraordinary: [43.38] if [43.50] enough [43.84] mass [44.10] is [44.24] compressed [44.80] into [45.04] a [45.18] small [45.42] enough [45.72] space, [46.66] it [46.76] would [46.94] create [47.34] a [47.44] region [47.92] where [48.20] spacetime [48.88] curves [49.34] so [49.62] severely [50.56] that [50.78] *nothing [51.26] can [51.42] escape* [52.70] - [52.74] not [52.92] even [53.20] light. [54.70] This [54.96] was [55.12] the [55.28] first [55.64] theoretical [56.30] prediction [57.04] of [57.16] what [57.32] we [57.48] now [57.76] call [58.30] *black [58.70] holes*. [60.18] In [60.28] our [60.42] next [60.70] segment, [61.50] we'll [61.70] see [61.94] how [62.18] these [62.42] theoretical [63.04] objects [63.56] actually [63.96] form [64.20] in [64.28] the [64.42] universe."
