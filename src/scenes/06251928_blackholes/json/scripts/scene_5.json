  "title": "Time Dilation and Spaghettification",
  "narration": "Now that we understand the *structure* of black holes, let's explore the _extreme physics_ that occurs near them. ... As you approach the event horizon, something *remarkable* happens: time itself begins to *slow down*. This gravitational time dilation means that while mere seconds pass for someone falling in, *years* could pass for an observer watching from afar. ... But that's not all. The immense gravity creates *tidal forces* so strong that they would stretch you vertically and compress you horizontally in a process aptly named *spaghettification*. ... These bizarre effects highlight how black holes _warp the very fabric_ of spacetime. Next, we'll discover how even these cosmic monsters can't escape the laws of *quantum mechanics*.",
