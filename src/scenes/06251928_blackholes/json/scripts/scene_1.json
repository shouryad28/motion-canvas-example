  "narration": "So, what exactly *is* a black hole? ... Simply put, a black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity has become so _incredibly extreme_ that absolutely *nothing* can escape from it. ... Not even light itself, the fastest thing in the universe, can break free once it crosses a certain boundary. ... These cosmic monsters are born when *massive stars* collapse at the end of their lives, crushing matter into an infinitely small point. ... The boundary around a black hole where escape becomes impossible is called the *event horizon* - think of it as the ultimate _point of no return_. ... To truly understand how these fascinating objects work, we need to dive into *Einstein's theory* of general relativity.",
