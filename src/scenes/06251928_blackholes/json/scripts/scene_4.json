  "narration": "Now that we've seen how black holes form, let's explore what lies *inside* these cosmic monsters. ... At the very heart of a black hole is the *singularity* - a point of _infinite density_ where all the matter has collapsed. ... Surrounding this is the *event horizon*, the infamous _point of no return_. Once anything crosses this boundary, not even *light* can escape. The size of this boundary is determined by the *Schwarzschild radius*, which depends on the black hole's mass. ... Outside the event horizon, we often find an *accretion disk* - a swirling disk of superheated matter spiraling inward. ... These key structures create some of the most *extreme physics* in the universe, as we'll see next.",
