  "title": "Formation of Black Holes",
  "narration": "Einstein's equations predicted them, but how do black holes *actually form*? ... The answer lies in the _dramatic death_ of massive stars. When a star at least *twenty times* our Sun's mass exhausts its nuclear fuel, fusion can no longer support it against gravity's relentless pull. ... The core *collapses* in less than a second, triggering a spectacular *supernova explosion*. If the remaining core exceeds the *Chandrasekhar limit* \u2013 about three solar masses \u2013 nothing can stop the collapse. ... Space-time itself _caves in_, creating a black hole. Next, we'll explore the *anatomy* of these cosmic monsters.",
