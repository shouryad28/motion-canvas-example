  "script": "[0.18] Einstein's [0.94] equations [1.52] predicted [1.92] them, [2.70] but [2.90] how [3.08] do [3.24] black [3.52] holes [4.18] *actually [4.84] form*? [6.84] ... [6.88] The [7.04] answer [7.40] lies [7.78] in [7.88] the [7.98] _dramatic [8.62] death_ [9.08] of [9.24] massive [9.70] stars. [10.74] When [10.88] a [11.02] star [11.38] at [11.54] least [12.12] *twenty [12.56] times* [13.00] our [13.22] Sun's [13.56] mass [13.96] exhausts [14.52] its [14.74] nuclear [15.22] fuel, [16.16] fusion [16.56] can [16.72] no [16.90] longer [17.24] support [17.62] it [17.80] against [18.14] gravity's [18.66] relentless [19.26] pull. [21.52] ... [21.56] The [21.72] core [21.98] *collapses* [22.84] in [23.00] less [23.22] than [23.38] a [23.50] second, [24.20] triggering [24.70] a [24.82] spectacular [25.62] *supernova [26.38] explosion*. [27.66] If [27.80] the [27.92] remaining [28.40] core [28.66] exceeds [29.20] the [29.30] *Chandrasekhar [30.10] limit* [30.84] \u2013 [30.90] about [31.20] three [31.52] solar [31.82] masses [32.64] \u2013 [32.70] nothing [33.08] can [33.30] stop [33.56] the [33.68] collapse. [34.80] ... [34.88] Space-time [35.40] itself [36.12] _caves [36.52] in_, [36.98] creating [37.36] a [37.44] black [37.70] hole. [38.84] Next, [39.28] we'll [39.42] explore [39.82] the [39.92] *anatomy* [40.72] of [40.82] these [41.06] cosmic [41.48] monsters."
