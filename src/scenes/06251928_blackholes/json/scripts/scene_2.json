  "title": "Einstein's General Relativity",
  "narration": "Now that we understand what a black hole is, let's explore the *theoretical foundation* that predicted their existence. ... In 1915, Albert Einstein revolutionized our understanding of gravity with his theory of *general relativity*. Unlike Newton's view of gravity as a force, Einstein showed that massive objects actually _curve the fabric of spacetime itself_. ... His field equations mathematically describe how *mass and energy* bend space and time around them. Just one year later, in 1916, German physicist *Karl Schwarzschild* found the first exact solution to Einstein's equations. ... This solution predicted something extraordinary: if enough mass is compressed into a small enough space, it would create a region where spacetime curves so severely that *nothing can escape* - not even light. This was the first theoretical prediction of what we now call *black holes*. In our next segment, we'll see how these theoretical objects actually form in the universe.",
