  "script": "[0.20] Now [0.42] that [0.56] we've [0.76] seen [1.00] how [1.16] black [1.42] holes [1.78] form, [2.38] let's [2.58] explore [3.14] what [3.34] lies [3.62] *inside* [4.22] these [4.48] cosmic [4.96] monsters. [6.36] ... [6.40] At [6.50] the [6.64] very [6.94] heart [7.22] of [7.32] a [7.40] black [7.70] hole [8.04] is [8.20] the [8.30] *singularity* [9.66] - [9.70] a [9.82] point [10.14] of [10.28] _infinite [10.84] density_ [11.62] where [11.84] all [12.02] the [12.16] matter [12.48] has [12.70] collapsed. [14.82] ... [14.84] Surrounding [15.32] this [15.64] is [15.78] the [15.88] *event [16.26] horizon*, [16.98] the [17.16] infamous [17.70] _point [18.20] of [18.36] no [18.52] return_. [19.68] Once [19.96] anything [20.36] crosses [20.80] this [21.00] boundary, [21.62] not [21.86] even [22.10] *light* [22.58] can [22.74] escape. [24.20] The [24.36] size [24.64] of [24.74] this [24.96] boundary [25.46] is [25.58] determined [26.14] by [26.28] the [26.40] *Schwarzschild [27.26] radius*, [28.38] which [28.60] depends [29.04] on [29.14] the [29.26] black [29.56] hole's [29.90] mass. [31.62] ... [31.70] Outside [32.18] the [32.30] event [32.60] horizon, [33.74] we [33.92] often [34.26] find [34.66] an [34.74] *accretion [35.40] disk* [36.38] - [36.44] a [36.60] swirling [37.14] disk [37.58] of [37.78] superheated [38.44] matter [38.94] spiraling [39.54] inward. [41.26] ... [41.30] These [41.56] key [41.78] structures [42.36] create [42.74] some [42.92] of [43.04] the [43.16] most [43.50] *extreme [44.16] physics* [44.64] in [44.74] the [44.90] universe, [45.78] as [45.96] we'll [46.16] see [46.36] next."
