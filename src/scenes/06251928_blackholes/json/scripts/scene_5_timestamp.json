  "script": "[0.18] Now [0.38] that [0.50] we [0.62] understand [1.08] the [1.20] *structure* [1.72] of [1.84] black [2.10] holes, [2.80] let's [2.98] explore [3.48] the [3.56] _extreme [4.04] physics_ [4.50] that [4.62] occurs [5.00] near [5.18] them. [6.26] ... [6.34] As [6.46] you [6.56] approach [6.94] the [7.08] event [7.38] horizon, [8.10] something [8.54] *remarkable* [9.24] happens: [10.22] time [10.44] itself [10.90] begins [11.26] to [11.40] *slow [11.76] down*. [12.80] This [12.98] gravitational [13.74] time [13.98] dilation [14.54] means [14.82] that [14.96] while [15.12] mere [15.38] seconds [15.80] pass [16.14] for [16.30] someone [16.64] falling [17.04] in, [17.78] *years* [18.60] could [18.82] pass [19.10] for [19.22] an [19.34] observer [19.88] watching [20.30] from [20.48] afar. [21.54] ... [21.56] But [21.68] that's [21.94] not [22.22] all. [22.84] The [22.96] immense [23.34] gravity [23.80] creates [24.26] *tidal [24.68] forces* [25.64] so [25.92] strong [26.28] that [26.42] they [26.58] would [26.78] stretch [27.10] you [27.26] vertically [28.14] and [28.28] compress [28.76] you [28.90] horizontally [30.02] in [30.12] a [30.22] process [30.78] aptly [31.22] named [32.10] *spaghettification*. [35.08] ... [35.14] These [35.38] bizarre [35.80] effects [36.40] highlight [36.80] how [36.96] black [37.26] holes [37.86] _warp [38.16] the [38.28] very [38.60] fabric_ [39.02] of [39.20] spacetime. [40.54] Next, [41.30] we'll [41.46] discover [41.98] how [42.28] even [42.52] these [42.78] cosmic [43.30] monsters [43.92] can't [44.18] escape [44.60] the [44.74] laws [45.10] of [45.24] *quantum [45.70] mechanics*."
