  "script": "[0.20] So, [0.78] what [0.92] exactly [1.66] *is* [2.36] a [2.44] black [2.74] hole? [4.12] ... [4.20] Simply [4.54] put, [5.16] a [5.22] black [5.52] hole [5.86] is [5.98] a [6.06] region [6.38] of [6.56] spacetime [7.18] where [7.36] gravity [7.80] has [7.98] become [8.46] so [8.98] _incredibly [9.66] extreme_ [10.56] that [10.84] absolutely [11.44] *nothing* [11.94] can [12.10] escape [12.50] from [12.72] it. [13.80] ... [13.86] Not [14.12] even [14.40] light [14.60] itself, [15.40] the [15.60] fastest [16.08] thing [16.28] in [16.36] the [16.52] universe, [17.48] can [17.68] break [17.98] free [18.24] once [18.42] it [18.52] crosses [18.94] a [19.04] certain [19.34] boundary. [20.94] ... [20.98] These [21.24] cosmic [21.70] monsters [22.18] are [22.36] born [23.00] when [23.16] *massive [23.62] stars* [24.06] collapse [24.52] at [24.62] the [24.76] end [24.90] of [25.00] their [25.20] lives, [26.22] crushing [26.62] matter [27.00] into [27.26] an [27.40] infinitely [27.96] small [28.24] point. [29.58] ... [29.60] The [29.74] boundary [30.14] around [30.40] a [30.48] black [30.80] hole [31.12] where [31.28] escape [31.66] becomes [32.04] impossible [32.74] is [32.90] called [33.20] the [33.32] *event [33.70] horizon* [34.96] - [35.02] think [35.22] of [35.34] it [35.58] as [35.74] the [35.94] ultimate [36.40] _point [36.84] of [36.98] no [37.14] return_. [38.82] ... [38.86] To [39.04] truly [39.40] understand [39.98] how [40.14] these [40.40] fascinating [40.98] objects [41.40] work, [42.10] we [42.22] need [42.38] to [42.50] dive [42.76] into [43.06] *Einstein's [43.72] theory* [44.28] of [44.44] general [44.80] relativity."
